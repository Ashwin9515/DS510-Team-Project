He was charged with disorderly conduct and inducing panic.  

Dimassimo was interviewed by CNN after the incident.  He stated his intention was to take the podium from Trump and send a message to CNN.  The interview did not address Dimassimo's past political affiliations.

Videos and social media posts attributed to Dimassimo, including a film trailer titled ""Red Black Blue,"" have circulated online.  These materials contain violent imagery and language.  The extent to which these materials reflect Dimassimo's views and motivations requires further verification.  Reliable sources for confirming the authenticity of these materials and their connection to Dimassimo include Wright State University's student records, social media platform verification, and court documents related to the incident.

It is unclear whether Dimassimo's actions were motivated by political views, a desire for attention, or other factors.  Claims of connections to specific political figures or movements require further substantiation.  Reliable sources for investigating these claims include statements from Dimassimo, law enforcement reports, and credible news outlets."

Jackson, Jimmy Kimmel, and Donald Trump are unsubstantiated and presented in a biased, inflammatory manner.  It conflates commentary with established fact and relies on inflammatory language.

It suggests a video exists where Samuel L. Jackson criticizes Donald Trump on Jimmy Kimmel Live! while using a Magic 8-Ball.  To verify this, one could search reputable sources like the Jimmy Kimmel Live! website, ABC News, or credible entertainment news outlets.

The article also makes unsubstantiated claims about an individual named Bill Taylor and his alleged comments about Barack Obama's qualifications and birth certificate.  Without further information, it's impossible to verify these claims.  If this individual exists and is a public figure, searching reputable news archives and fact-checking websites might provide clarification.

Finally, the article's assertion that Donald Trump supporters ""hate everyone equally"" is a sweeping generalization and not a factual statement.  Political polling and analysis from reputable sources would be more informative about public opinion."

Some hosts, including Melissa Francis and Andrea Tantaros, expressed skepticism about the president's display of emotion. Meghan McCain also voiced concerns, suggesting the president should have visited Chicago instead.  The segment criticized President Obama's subsequent announcement of plans to work with Congress on gun safety measures, including expanded background checks and closing gun show loopholes. Some hosts argued these measures would violate the separation of powers doctrine.  

For verification of the hosts' exact statements and the overall tone of the segment, review the original broadcast recording or transcripts.  News archives from reputable sources such as the Internet Archive, NexisUni, or transcripts from Fox News itself may be helpful.  It's important to note that characterizing the segment as ""Onionghazi"" reflects a particular viewpoint and may not be a neutral description."

The dossier, which alleges compromising information Russia may possess concerning President Trump, including an incident involving prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room, has not been corroborated by U.S. intelligence agencies.  The seriousness of the allegations, and their potential implications regarding Russian influence on the U.S. election, are being investigated.  For more information, consult reporting from reputable news organizations such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Reuters.  Samantha Bee's commentary on the allegations should be understood as satire."

In a Facebook post, Palin expressed frustration with the outcome and called on conservatives to challenge what she perceives as a flawed system.  She also criticized Republicans who did not support Donald Trump's presidential candidacy.

Palin's post contained strong rhetoric and accusations against Clinton, the Obama administration, and Congressional leaders.  It is important to note that multiple investigations into Clinton's email practices, including one by the FBI, did not result in criminal charges.  For detailed information on these investigations and their findings, consult reports from the FBI and the Department of Justice.

The letter, which invoked the Holocaust and threatened genocide, was signed ""Americans for a Better Way.""  The San Jose Police Department is investigating the incident.  Faisal Yazadi, board president of the Evergreen Islamic Center, expressed a desire for dialogue and understanding.

While some have attributed a rise in hate crimes and hateful rhetoric following the election to then President-elect Trump's campaign rhetoric, establishing a direct causal link requires further investigation.  Reliable sources for hate crime statistics include the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program and the Southern Poverty Law Center. It is important to note that correlation does not equal causation, and multiple factors may contribute to fluctuations in hate crime reporting."

He stated he had already addressed the issue extensively and directed further inquiries to the Clinton campaign.  The press conference took place during a historic presidential visit to Hiroshima.  News reports suggested President Obama appeared frustrated by the focus on the email controversy during this trip.

It conflates unrelated concepts like ""unvetted Muslim nations,"" ""Sharia law,"" and the actions of ISIS, fostering harmful stereotypes. 

It's crucial to separate the actions of extremist groups like ISIS from the beliefs and practices of the vast majority of Muslims worldwide.  ISIS's interpretation of Islam is not representative of mainstream Islamic thought and is widely condemned by Muslim communities globally.

The claim that liberals are trying to implement Sharia law in America is unfounded and lacks evidence.  There is no credible evidence of any widespread movement among liberals to institute Sharia law.

The article mentions a video and cites MEMRI.  While MEMRI provides translations of Middle Eastern media, it has been criticized for selective translations and promoting a biased narrative.  To verify the claims about the video, it's essential to consult multiple reliable sources, including news organizations with established fact-checking procedures and academic experts on the region.  Without further verifiable information, the claims about the video's content remain unsubstantiated.

Reliable sources for information on Islam and the Middle East include:

* Associated Press
* Reuters
* BBC
* The New York Times
* The Washington Post
* Academic institutions with Middle Eastern studies programs

It is important to approach information about sensitive topics like religion and culture with critical thinking and rely on credible, unbiased sources."

The woman, identified as Candic Spivey, posted a video of the confrontation on Facebook. In the video, Spivey accuses the man, identified as Jeffrey Polizzi, of filming her while asking seemingly innocuous questions.  Spivey stated she reported the incident to the Nassau County Sheriff's Office.

News reports citing the *Daily Mail* claim Polizzi has prior charges related to video voyeurism and that an appeal related to this charge occurred last week.  These reports also suggest other women have come forward with similar complaints against Polizzi.  It is important to note that the *Daily Mail* is a tabloid publication and its reporting should be verified with more reliable sources.  

To verify these claims, consulting Nassau County Sheriff's Office records and court documents would be necessary.  It is also important to note that at this time, it is uncertain whether Polizzi has been charged with any crime related to the incident with Spivey.  Further information is needed to confirm the details of this event and any related legal proceedings."

Nance cited Trump's July 2016 statement about Russia hacking Hillary Clinton's emails and his alleged reluctance to accept intelligence community conclusions about Russian interference in the 2016 election.  Nance suggested this behavior, along with Trump's public statements and actions, indicates authoritarian tendencies and a potential disregard for checks and balances. He hypothesized about potential future actions Trump might take to limit press freedoms and the intelligence community's oversight role, but offered no concrete evidence of such plans.  

To verify Nance's claims, consult reputable sources such as fact-checking websites, transcripts of Trump's speeches and interviews, and reports from independent journalistic organizations regarding Trump's interactions with the intelligence community.  It is important to note that Nance's statements represent his opinion and analysis, and should be evaluated alongside other perspectives on the issue."

They point to instances where Fox News personalities questioned Obama's legitimacy and place of birth, and allege that the network now decries similar treatment of President Trump.  

To assess this claim, a comparison of Fox News' coverage of both presidencies would be necessary. This would involve reviewing transcripts, broadcasts, and articles from reputable archives.  The Huffington Post video mentioned in the original article could be part of this review, but its objectivity should also be considered.  Further research from neutral fact-checking organizations and academic studies on media bias would be beneficial.  It is important to avoid generalizations and focus on specific instances of reporting and commentary to determine whether a pattern of hypocrisy exists."

He alluded to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election and a meeting at Trump Tower, but the exact nature of his criticism requires further clarification.  

To determine the precise details of Smith's remarks and their context, one could consult the full transcript of the exchange between Smith and Wallace, potentially available from The Washington Post as the original article suggests.  Additionally, reviewing reporting from reputable news organizations on the events Smith referenced would be beneficial.

It alleges societal breakdown, manipulative political processes, and widespread misinformation, but offers no concrete evidence.  The author's claims about ""puppetry,"" ""psychopathy,"" and ""hypnosis"" in political leadership lack factual basis and employ inflammatory language.  Similarly, assertions about a ""compliant"" populace and ""mass hysteria"" are unsupported.

To understand the current state of American society and politics, it's crucial to rely on credible sources of information such as:

* **Reputable news organizations:**  Seek out established news outlets with a track record of fact-checking and balanced reporting.  Be aware of potential biases and compare information across multiple sources.
* **Academic research:**  Scholarly articles and books provide in-depth analysis of social and political trends, often based on rigorous research methodologies.
* **Government data and reports:**  Official statistics and reports from government agencies can offer valuable insights into various aspects of society.
* **Non-governmental organizations (NGOs):**  NGOs focused on specific issues often conduct research and advocacy work, providing valuable perspectives.

By consulting these resources, individuals can form informed opinions based on evidence rather than unsubstantiated claims.  It is important to critically evaluate information and avoid emotionally charged rhetoric."

While some social media users speculated that his departure was due to his critical coverage of President Trump, Smith himself stated that he left to pursue other opportunities.  He later joined CNBC.  

It is true that Smith sometimes offered on-air analysis that differed from other Fox News programming, particularly regarding the Trump administration.  However, attributing his departure solely to anti-Trump bias is speculative.  For more information on Smith's career and departure from Fox News, consult reputable news sources such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, and NPR.

The social media post referenced makes several unsubstantiated claims, including an inaccurate portrayal of an incident where Smith cut off a guest's microphone.  Reliable sources indicate the interruption occurred during a discussion about a different topic.  Similarly, the post misrepresents Smith's reporting on a 2017 Chicago kidnapping incident.  Fact-checks from reputable news organizations debunked the claim that Smith attempted to downplay the racial aspects of the crime."

Limbaugh suggested that Obama's praise from some conservative media outlets was a calculated move to enhance credibility. He contrasted what he perceived as a unifying first half of the speech with a second half that he felt exploited racial tensions. Limbaugh also claimed that Republicans, including Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, had chosen not to oppose Obama's policies to avoid appearing obstructive during the presidential election year.  He further asserted that the narrative surrounding the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, was a ""lie.""

To verify Limbaugh's claims, one could consult transcripts and recordings of Obama's Dallas speech, statements from McConnell and Ryan regarding their legislative strategies in 2016, and reports from reputable news organizations on the events in Ferguson.

It also implies a video exists related to these claims.

Without more context or reliable sources, it's impossible to verify any of these assertions.  To determine the truthfulness of the claims, one would need to research:

* **Whether a specific Democratic protest occurred at the suggested time.** News archives and fact-checking websites could be helpful.
* **If the protest was violent.**  Again, news sources and potentially police reports would be relevant.
* **The connection, if any, between the protest and job creation or job reports.**  This claim requires further clarification to even begin verifying.
* **The veracity of claims about President Trump's job creation record.**  Official government data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) would be a reliable source.
* **The content and relevance of the mentioned video.**  Without a working link, it's impossible to assess its value.

In short, the original post presents unsubstantiated claims.  Further investigation using reliable sources is necessary to determine any truth to the assertions."

Barry stated that Zervos described Trump embracing her, then thrusting his genitals at her.  Trump denies the allegation.

Barry claims Zervos previously praised Trump and supported him politically. He suggests her current accusations are motivated by a desire to regain attention after Trump declined an invitation to her restaurant.

Zervos has accused Trump of sexual assault before.  [It would be beneficial to link to reliable sources detailing Zervos' past allegations and Trump's responses, such as court documents or reputable news organizations.]  It is unclear when the alleged incident described by Barry took place.

Barry's statement also includes personal attacks against Trump and speculation about the motivations of sexual assault victims generally.  These should be considered opinion and not factual reporting.  The article's original framing of a widespread conspiracy against Trump is unsubstantiated."

The incident resulted in significant backlash and the termination of her CNN New Year's Eve hosting duties.  

The article's comparison to Hillary Clinton's response to the 2016 election results requires clarification. While Clinton has cited factors such as Russian interference,  fake news, and misogyny as contributing to her loss (sources like the Mueller Report and various academic studies can offer further information on these topics),  it's inaccurate to say she made ""no mention"" of other factors.  Clinton also acknowledged shortcomings in her own campaign and the Democratic party's messaging.  Whether these explanations constitute ""scapegoating"" is a matter of opinion and open to interpretation.

The article's claim that Democratic voters overwhelmingly preferred Bernie Sanders lacks supporting evidence. While Sanders enjoyed significant support, exit polls and primary results indicate Clinton won the popular vote and a majority of pledged delegates.  For accurate primary election data, consult sources like the Federal Election Commission or reputable news organizations' election coverage.

Finally, the article's reference to ""St. Century Wire"" requires scrutiny regarding its journalistic standards and potential biases to determine its reliability as a source."

The incident sparked widespread condemnation and resulted in professional repercussions for Griffin.

Hillary Clinton, following her 2016 presidential election loss, cited several factors, including Russian interference, the spread of misinformation, and misogyny.  While the extent of Russian interference is still being investigated (see reports from the Mueller investigation and Senate Intelligence Committee), the spread of fake news and the role of social media platforms are documented topics of research (consult academic journals and fact-checking organizations).  Whether misogyny played a significant role in the election outcome is a subject of ongoing debate among political scientists and social commentators.  It is also a verifiable fact that Senator Bernie Sanders garnered significant support during the Democratic primaries.

The original article's claim that Clinton made ""no mention"" of voter preference for Sanders is unsubstantiated.  To accurately assess Clinton's statements on this topic, review her public speeches and interviews from that period.  The article also presents an unsupported assertion about ""clear Democrat voter"" preference for Sanders.  Primary election results and polling data from reputable sources should be consulted for accurate information on voter preferences.  Finally, the article's reference to ""St. Century Wire"" lacks context and credibility.  The reliability and potential bias of this source are unknown."

The masked individual's statements are somewhat rambling and difficult to understand fully. They appear to express opposition to Trump and racism, mentioning a ""melting pot."" Fletcher also interviews another individual who claims to see diversity among Trump supporters.

The original post frames the video as evidence that left-leaning protesters are ""clueless,"" ""sheeple,"" and ""indoctrinated.""  However, the video presents a limited interaction with a small number of individuals and does not substantiate such broad claims.  The political views and motivations of protest attendees may vary widely.  Further information about the specific protest depicted, including its location and date, would be needed to provide a more complete context.  News outlets or independent journalistic sources covering the event could offer additional perspectives."

Larson's column accused Tyson of mocking a young girl's aspirations to live on Jupiter.  However, this anecdote appears to be a hoax; no evidence of such an interaction exists, including any tweets or public statements from Tyson.  

Following Tyson's public denial and the online debunking of the story, Larson published a final column acknowledging his error and resigning from his position.  He attributed his mistake to not verifying the information's source.  

While Larson expressed regret for his error, he also characterized himself as a victim of online backlash.  The extent and nature of this backlash are difficult to verify independently.  Reliable sources for further information could include the Twin Falls Times-News itself and archived versions of Larson's columns."

The article linked appears to be an opinion piece analyzing the state of the Trump campaign at that time.

While the article claims a ""meltdown,"" the specific details about Republican panic, calls to pull funding, and begging for help in states like Ohio and Utah require further verification.  Reliable sources such as major news outlets and polling data from reputable organizations should be consulted to confirm these claims.  The article's characterization of Trump's behavior and motivations is also subjective and should be corroborated by factual reporting.

To ascertain the accuracy of the claims regarding Trump's standing in polls, it's recommended to consult sources like the Pew Research Center and RealClearPolitics, which aggregate polling data.

The photos appear to show Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer meeting with Russian officials Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, respectively.  The tweet's context suggests these meetings are being presented as evidence against claims of Russian connections involving Trump.  

It's important to verify the context of these photos.  When and where were they taken? What was the nature of the meetings?  Reliable sources such as fact-checking websites (e.g., Snopes, PolitiFact), news archives (e.g., The Associated Press, Reuters), and official government records could provide more information and help determine the accuracy of the claims made in the tweet.  Without further context, it's difficult to assess the significance of these photos.  The tweet mentions a video report by Stuart Hooper and ""Centuri Wire,"" but the reliability of these sources needs to be evaluated."

He also falsely asserted that Obama was honored by ISIS.  There is no evidence to support these claims.  Fact-checks from reputable news organizations, such as the New York Times, PolitiFact, and the Washington Post, debunked these allegations.

Trump also made controversial remarks about the Khan family, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention after their son, a Muslim American soldier, was killed in Iraq.  He suggested, without evidence, that Hillary Clinton was somehow involved in the founding of ISIS and referred to her as ""crooked Hillary.""  He frequently used Obama's middle name, Hussein, in a manner widely perceived as an attempt to otherize and discredit the president.

Trump's campaign rhetoric also included unsubstantiated claims about President Obama's handling of the Orlando nightclub shooting and the annexation of Crimea by Russia.

He used examples of candidates engaging in seemingly ""ordinary"" activities, like Hillary Clinton's subway ride and John Kasich eating pizza, to highlight the performative aspects of campaigning.  Noah suggested that Donald Trump, then a leading Republican candidate, would be a suitable mascot.  The segment was clearly comedic and not intended as a serious policy proposal.

He reflected on those who may have refused to vote for him based on his race and suggested that some opposition stemmed from fear.  He also noted the political benefits some may have felt from electing the first African American president.  Obama pointed to his reelection as evidence of progress on racial issues in America, contrasting it with his initial election. While acknowledging the persistence of racism, he highlighted his victory over Mitt Romney as a sign of positive change.

It is important to note that claims of racism influencing voting patterns are complex and difficult to quantify.  Reliable polling data and academic research on voter behavior from reputable sources like the Pew Research Center and academic journals would be necessary to provide a more nuanced understanding of this issue.  Similarly,  characterizations of media coverage, such as that of Fox News, require further investigation and sourcing.
